# Objective:
- Introduces a framework for Deep Multi-View Clustering (DMVC) that is robust against adversarial attacks.
- Key Goal: Achieving robust clustering performance in the presence of adversarial perturbations.
- 
# Key features:
    - Feature extraction from different views.
    - Adversarial robustness techniques to combat perturbations.
    - Loss functions that guide the model to minimize clustering error while maintaining robustness.
# Key Steps: 
  Data Preprocessing: Different views of data are normalized and processed.
  Model Architecture: A deep learning model is built using TensorFlow.
  Training: The model is trained using adversarial training techniques to improve robustness.
  Clustering: After training, the model clusters data based on learned features.
